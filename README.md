This data repository contains the Othering &amp; Belonging Institute's residential zoning data, originally analyzed and published in the report [SCAG Report](https://belonging.berkeley.edu/)

## About the Data
This repository includes parcel-level shapefiles for all incorporated municipalities of the six SCAG region counties: Imperial, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Berbardino, and Ventura. Each shapefile contains a categorization of residential zoning based on the most recent publicly available zoning maps and municipal code at the time of initial analysis (Fall 2021). Zoning has been separated into three main categories, designated under the *Zoning* field: 

Zoning | Category | Description
------------ | ------------- | ------------- 
 1 | Single Family Residential | land zoned for only  detached, single-family residential land use, including two-family detached dwellings 
 2 | Multi-Family Residential | land zoned *not* restricted to single-family residential; zoned for mixed and multiple dwelling units, including apartment buildings, duplexes, townhomes, mobile home parks, and two-family attached dwellings.
 0 | Non-Residential | land zoned for non-residential use, including commercial, industrial, public, and recreation land use 
 3 | Non-Developable | land outside of municipal boundaries or developable land, including water, waterways, and sphere of influence land. *This category was removed from total land area for analysis.*

## About the Project
This residential zoning data and analysis is part of the Othering &amp; Belonging Institute's broader research on [SCAG report](https://belonging.berkeley.edu), an effort to unpack the extent, dynamics, and drivers of racial segregation in the Bay Area. 

Exclusionary, single-family zoning has long been cited as a driver for racial segregation. In order to examine the impact of single family zoning in the Bay Area, we gathered and categorized zoning shapefiles to measure the spatial distribution and extent of restricted single family zoning, specifically as a portion of total residential land use. In [SCAG report](https://belonging.berkeley.edu/), we used this residential zoning data to analyze measures of segregation against restricted single family zoning to show the role of zoning in driving segregation. We also used this residential zoning data to assess the characteristics of communities within and outside of restricted single family zoning in the Bay Area.
